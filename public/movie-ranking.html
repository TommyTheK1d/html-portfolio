<h2>The best three movies are:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
    <p>I really loved this movie and I can't believe it's been over 5 years since it came out. Time really flies.</p>

<h3>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</h3>
    <p>WHERE do I start?? The animation was *chefs kiss*.</p>
    
<h3>Deadpool</h3>
    <p>It's kind of hard to pick a third, seeing as I haven't seen a lot of my movies, but this one was really funny.</p>
